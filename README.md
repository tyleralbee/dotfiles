# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which I manage with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html).

There is only one file in this repo that is written by AI: `AGENTS.md`, and it
only exists so that you may use AI to better understand my dotfiles if you wish to.

I've spent many, many hours ensuring that my dotfiles are a viable tool for others
to learn from. I can say with confidence that the following areas are safe to use
as a reference when configuring your own system:

1. Zed IDE configuration (`.config/zed/*`)
2. Hyprland configuration (`.config/hypr/*`)
3. Bash shell configuration (`.bash*`, `.inputrc`)
4. Tmux configuration (`.tmux.conf`)
5. Git configuration (`.git*`)
6. Tridactyl configuration (`.config/tridactyl/*`)
7. GNU Stow configuration (`.stow*`)
8. GitHub CLI configuration (`.config/gh/*`)
9. Ghostty configuration (`.config/ghostty/*`)
10. Kanata configuration (`.config/kanata/*`)

Outside of the above, I wouldn't use my own dotfiles as a reference.
