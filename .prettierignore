# Most of the globs in this file aren't relevant to this project.
# Groups are ordered by likelihood of being kept when starting a new project.
# When I start a new repository, I remove things starting from the bottom.
# Groups that you probably want in your ignore file are towards to top.
# Towards the bottom, you can remove sections for tools you don't use.
# The lines in each section are ordered by specificity (directories > files).
